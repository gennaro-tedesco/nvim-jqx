1. INTRODUCTION				*jqx-introduction*

*nvim-jqx* is an interface to navigate and query json files from within neovim.
It allows to:

- populate the quickfix window with json keys, for easy look-up and navigation
- show the values in correspondence of said keys in a floating window, upon key press
- execute general and complicated `jq` queries, showing the results in a floating window

`jq` is a prerequisite, as `nvim-jqx` executes `jq` queries internally,
therefore you must have it installed.

==============================================================================
2. USAGE				*jqx-usage*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two commands are exposed to the user: `JqxList` and `JqxQuery`.

  JqxList       *JqxList*

	Open a json file and execute `JqxList`: the json is prettified and
	the quickfix window is populated with the first level keys.
	In the quickfix window press `X` on a key to query its values
  and show the results in a floating window; alternatively <CR> takes
  you to its location in the file. All other quickfix commands are left intact,
  so you can navigate it as you normally would, say with `cnext/cprevious` and so forth.

  `JqxList` accepts an optional argument representing the json type of the
  values you want to populate. For example `JqxList number` only populates the
  quickfix window with keys whose values are numerical: the available types
  are

  `JqxList number`
  `JqxList string`
  `JqxList boolean`
  `JqxList array`
  `JqxList object`
  `JqxList null`

  You can use autocompletion and the available types will prompt up directly
  for selection.


  JqxQuery       *JqxQuery*

  To execute more complicated queries for nested keys `nvim-jqx` exposes
  the command `JqxQuery`. The grammar is identical to the one you would use to
  query json files via `jq`; for example

>
  # example of jq grammar
  jq '.first_key[1].second_key' file.json

  # equivalent JqxQuery grammar
  :JqxQuery first_key[1].second_key
<

  `JqxQuery` can be used in line or as a prompt: in the latter case
  autocompletion with the json file keys is made available on the prompt.
  Notice that you would need to escape possible double quotes `"` for them to be
  correctly parsed. For instance `JqxQuery \"first.second\"` .

>
  # inline
  :JqxQuery <query>

  # prompt
  :JqxQuery<CR>
  enter query: <query>
<

  Commands              *jqx-commands*
  The full list of commands that the plugin provides is the below:

>
  `JqxList` populates the quickfix window with json keys
  `X` on a key, in the quickfix window, to query the corresponding json value
  `<Esc>` to close the floating window
  `<CR>` on a key, in the quickfix window, to go to its location in the file
  `JqxQuery` to prompt for a generic `jq` query
<

  The same commands described above work on yaml files as well. However, `yq`
  is required: https://github.com/mikefarah/yq

==============================================================================
3. CUSTOMISATION        *jqx-customisation*

  If you prefer key-mappings rather than commands simply bind
  `nmap ... <Plug>JqxList` to access `JqxList`.

  There is no interface exposed for `JqxQuery`, so you
  would do `nnoremap ... <cmd> JqxQuery` .

  The list of json keys is sorted alphabetically in the quickfix window:
  if instead you prefer having it in the same order as they appear in the original file,
  override the default configuration with (notice it requires `jq >= 1.5`)
  `lua require('nvim-jqx.config').sort = false`


  The default key to open a query in floating window is `X`: you can ovverride it with
  `lua require('nvim-jqx.config').query_key = ...`
